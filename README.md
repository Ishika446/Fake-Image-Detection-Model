# Fake-Image-Detection-Model
This model can detct which image is fake or real . I used transfer learning with MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network. By applying fine-tuning techniques, I adapted the pre-trained model to effectively classify real vs fake images. This approach helped save training time while still achieving strong performance on the task
